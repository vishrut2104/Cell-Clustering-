# Cell-Clustering-
This is a machine project where we performed cell clustering on features extracted using pathologyGAN and Resnet50. The clustering algorithms used were K-means clustering and Louvain Clustering.
• Conducted image analysis on human colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal colon mucosa (NORM) using PathologyGAN and ResNet50. • Reduced the representations (PathologyGAN, ResNet50) to two 100-dimensional feature sets using PCA and UMAP.
• Tested both PCA and UMAP feature sets using K-Means and GMM clustering algorithms..
• Compared the performance of the clustering algorithms with Hierarchical Clustering and Louvain clustering algorithms.
• Analyzed the results and presented findings in a report.
